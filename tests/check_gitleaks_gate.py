"""Prove the secret-scanning gate can actually fail before believing it passes.

B14 asks for a secret scanner in CI. It does not ask whether the scanner is wired up
correctly, and "no leaks found" is what a working gate reports on a clean tree and what
a misconfigured one reports on any tree at all. Those two are indistinguishable from the
green tick alone, which is how gates ship inert.

So this runs the gate TWO-SIDED:

  planted  a synthetic credential is committed into a throwaway copy — gitleaks must
           exit with LEAK_EXIT specifically, NOT merely non-zero: gitleaks uses 1 for
           an operational error, so "non-zero" would accept a scan that broke before
           reading anything. This is the side that can actually fail.
  clean    the real working tree — gitleaks must exit zero, so a gate that simply
           fails on everything is not mistaken for a working one.

THE COPY IS NOT INCIDENTAL. The planted secret is committed to git history, and history
is not undone by deleting the file — measured: after `git rm` + commit, gitleaks still
exits 1, which is the whole reason the scheduled scan uses fetch-depth: 0. Planting into
the real repo would therefore poison its history permanently. `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`
also survives a `finally`-skipping SIGTERM better than an in-place mutate-and-restore,
which leaves the repo dirty if the runner is cancelled mid-step.

# A synthetic GitHub PAT, assembled at runtime so that THIS FILE never contains a
# PAT-shaped string. The body below is not a credential and the `ghp_` prefix is only
# ever joined to it in memory, which is what keeps the clean-side scan honest: if the
# literal lived here, the real tree would scan dirty and the probe would be testing
# itself.
#
# THE BODY MUST HAVE REAL ENTROPY. This was originally 36 repeated 'A's, which read as
# obviously-not-a-credential and was wrong for a reason worth recording:
#
#   gitleaks 8.28.0 (the version this repo pins) applies an ENTROPY FLOOR to the
#   github-pat rule. Measured 2026-09-20: 'ghp_' + 'A'*36 scores 0.67 and is NOT
#   reported, while the string below scores 5.22 and is. The forge host's own
#   /usr/bin/gitleaks — which reports `version is set by build process` — has no such
#   floor and DID report the all-A's value, so the probe passed locally and the gate
#   shipped inert. CI caught it on the first run, which is the entire point of running
#   the planted side at all.
#
# So: do not "simplify" this to a repeated character, and do not substitute a vendor's
# published example key either — gitleaks allowlists several of those by default and
# the probe would then pass for the wrong reason.
