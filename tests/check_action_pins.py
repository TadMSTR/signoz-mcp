"""Fail when one action's subpaths are pinned to different commits.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO CATCH IS MEASURED, not hypothetical. Dependabot PR #12
bumped `github/codeql-action/init` 4.37.9 -> 4.38.0 and nothing else, because
Dependabot treats `init`, `analyze` and `upload-sarif` as three separate
dependencies. Both CodeQL matrix jobs then died with:

    Loaded a configuration file for version '4.38.0', but running version '4.37.9'

Nothing in CI caught that. CodeRabbit did, in prose, on one PR. `.github/dependabot.yml`
now groups the codeql-action subpaths so Dependabot cannot raise that PR again — but a
group in a config file is a policy, and a hand edit to a workflow is not bound by it.
This is the gate that binds it.

THE RULE IS GENERAL, deliberately. It groups by `owner/repo` — the first two path
segments — so `github/codeql-action/init` and `github/codeql-action/analyze` fall in one
group while `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python` stay separate, as they should.
Any future multi-subpath action is covered without an edit here.

AND IT RUNS TWO-SIDED, for the reason tests/check_gitleaks_gate.py spells out at length:
"no divergence found" is what a working checker reports on a consistent tree and what a
checker with a broken regex reports on ANY tree. Those are indistinguishable from the
green tick. So every run also plants a divergence into a throwaway copy and requires the
checker to find it. The previous build's retrospective counted five gates in this fleet
that could not fail; this one proves it can, on every single run, rather than once by
hand at review time.

# does not describe. A `uses: ./.github/workflows/x.yml` local reference has no `@` at
# all and is correctly ignored.
# Horizontal whitespace only — `\s` matches newlines, so `^\s*` would happily start the
# match on a blank line ABOVE the `uses:` and report a line number two off. A gate that
# names the wrong line sends the reader to the wrong place, which is its own small lie.
